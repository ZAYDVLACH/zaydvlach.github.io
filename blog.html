          <div class="post-text" id="Feb6">
            <p>Ok, ew, am I right??? <br>
              A year ago I started lifting regularly. Don’t worry, I stopped after a few months. But I’d go down to the beautiful free weight room below the floor with all the machines in the Swarthmore gym, and I’d lift. My favorite has always been squats. My legs have always been big. I get this from my father. He has these short but massive thighs and calves, and he thoughtlessly passed them on to me. <br>
              I love squatting and I love getting lower and lower. I love the feeling of all that weight on top of you, pushing you down, and the way you back wants to bend out and snap and the pain on your collarbone. As I kept lifting I was able to squat deeper and deeper, until one day I squatted and I felt this beautiful pressure in my hips. A pocket of air, pushing and trying to escape. I tried to sink even lower, but it wouldn’t quite pop. I knew immediately this was the most important thing I'd do that day. I reracked the weight and laid down. I brought my knee to the opposite corner of my chest and rocked and exhaled, pulling it closer and closer until, pop. <br>
              AHHHHHHHH<br>
              So fucking good. It reverberated through my whole body. It was better than about half of the sex I’ve had. I lay gasping with pleasure, all sweaty, shamelessly on the floor of the gym. The student atheletes and devoted lifters all walked around me. No one cared of course. <br>
              Other side. Knee to chest, rock and exhale. pop. OHHHHHHHH fuck. So Good. This is my new high. <br>
              I chased it every day. On a normal day I could get two out of each hip socket. In the mornings, I’d go down to the library basement, situate myself in front of the wall of Heidigger secondary scholarship, and slowly sink into a lower and lower squat. Rocking, slowly exhaling, until finally, release. My head swimming, I’d stand up, dizzily walk back to my desk and slowly sink down into my chair. This is pleasure. In the evenings, normally after a run so I’d already be warm and pliable, I’d hold my dresser and sink and sink feel the pressure building and oh, so good. Sometimes, if I’d get really lucky, I’d fart too. <br>
              The indians have known for thousands of years that contorting your body can expel various substances. I am only a novice in the art, but the farts I could get out of a deep squat are like no others. They’d come out like hostages: held at gunpoint, hands held above their heads, in an orderly line. I could feel that they weren’t prepared to leave, that they wanted to continue to infest my body for days or weeks. But no, not today! My hips were getting looser, and I was getting in touch with my body. <br>
              Over the course of the year I fell out with my body. I stopped running, I had to write my thesis, etc. Recently, I’ve been spending more time alone that I previously did. Whenever I start getting habituated to solitude, I pick up a worrying set of habits. One of them is some sort of painful bodily training. Right now it’s yoga and push-ups. Karl Ove on push-ups: “How desperate do you have to be to start doing push-ups to solve your problems?” Yup. This desperate it turns out. <br>
              I’ve been following B. K. S. Iyengar’s Light on Yoga routine. The best part is the last pose where I try to fold my body at the mid-back, so my head and shoulders are pushed into the ground and my chin is pushed to my sternum and my torso and legs rise straight over me. See image. I can only sort of do this, and I end up rolling around a lot to try and get into the pose. I lift my legs over my body, while lying on my back and trying to arch myself into the air, only to shift too much weight over my head and roll backwards. I haven’t moved my body in this way in so many years. Each time I do it, I’ve done it maybe 4 times now, it feels like I’m about to snap my spine, but I’m always fine at the end of it and I can’t help myself from laughing hysterically. My body is doing new things for me. We are doing new things together.<br>
              And we are doing things we’ve done before together. Like popping our hips and farting in new and different positions. Ugh, it feels great. On a good day I wake up and lay around for 30 minutes. Then I get up and roll out the yoga mat. Do the asanas. Sumersault and laugh in wonder. Do some push-ups. Work myself into deep squats, pop my hips, and fart. Laugh again. Drink some coffee, take a shit, eat something. Normally it’s yogurt or a quesadilla or a smoothie. My cooking has gone down the drain. Then I take a bike ride or go for a run. The bike is so much more fun, I do it more. My fixie is the best. It’s the best because it’s no longer a fixie. <br>
              I am cowardly. I am afraid of injuring myself and others. I am afraid of crashing my bike. When it was a fixie all I could think about was how I was about to crash and break my collarbones. So I flipped the wheel, and bought some brakes. <br>
              Oh my god! What a hassel that was. I wanted mini v-brakes. No one has those, except the 100 dollar BOX ones. Fuck. Ok, fine, normal v-brakes, so popular, on every bike from 1990-2010, right? Some how, so difficult. This fucking city doesn’t have one proper bike co-op. Everything at the co-ops costs the same as new! And then they give you a v-brake, but without the noodle or the bolts. Sorry, you’ll have to buy those new… That’s as expensive as buying the whole thing new! So I went to an old white man in the bronx and bought a pair of 30 year old sram v-brakes and some of the worst levers I’ve ever encountered for 35 dollars. He gave it to me in a box. Fine. I set it up, but the levers were too bad. I rode on it, and it was great, but it was terrible. So I caved, and I ordered the cheapest set of shimano levers for 25 dollars. That and some 800mm riser bars. What a dream the bike is now. It is literally perfect. And so beautiful. And those shimano levers are so perfect. Beautiful finish, beautiful feel, literally makes my heart beat faster looking at them. I love shimano so much. I hate capitalism, but I love shimano. <br>
              So I take my single speed, with its perfect raw steel finish and brooklyn headbadge and I go through central park until my legs cramp and I have to walk it up hills, and then I slog back home. I am very slow and weak right now. I love being on a bike. <br>
              I am loath to admit this, but there is something great about yoga. Even when I’m standing, in the first pose and between poses, I feel my whole body in a different way than I normally do. I feel my weight pushing through the soles of my feet, I feel the way my back is cricked, I feel my lungs expanding and contracting. At the end, I lay on my back for a few minutes. Every muscle has been stressed, and then me and my collection of organs and muscles relax together, and we can all feel the others. It’s very beautiful. <br>
              Then I go to work. :( I don’t like it! </p>

  <h3>November 9th, 2025</h3>
  <div class="post-layout">
    <div class="post-text" id="Nov9">
      <p>Here is a speech I wrote in my second year of Deep Springs. I think about it a lot. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I cannot figure out an elevator pitch. I give up. 
        In term 2 Declan and I climbed up to the Druid, and then we went a bit farther. I now always go a bit farther. I increasingly think that it’s hilarious, and sort of telling, that the normal hike is the druid. Upon reaching the druid you get a good look at our valley, and a good look at a big protruding rock, and a sort of vague idea about what’s outside of our valley. It’s a place to contemplate being in this valley, not to fantasize about escaping to the next valley over. 
        <br>
        In term 2 neither Declan nor I were really in the right headspace to contemplate being in this valley, so we kept walking. If you walk a mile or two further you cross the Inyo range and you begin to descend into Eureka. 
        <br>
        Here’s a secret (sort of):
        <br>
        Past the druid, if you climb up the hill in a straight line from the druid and follow the ridge of that hill you will eventually almost fall into an old mine. It’s about 30 feet deep and has the beginning of a collapsed tunnel at the bottom. I think I’ve only showed Declan. I recommend looking at it. 
        <br>
        Declan and I walked past the mine and climbed to my favorite rock and sat there a while. Declan smoked a cigarette. I made a comment about people who could laugh at a family funeral. It was very windy that day. The wind was so strong it hurt to look at the sand dunes. We turned around and walked back.
        <br>
        I’ve heard stories that the whole valley is covered in abandoned mines. Tim Winkler showed me one he found while 4 wheeling near chocolate mountain term 1. He drove me up there so I would know how to climb chocolate mountain with the first years. Recently I’ve been fantasizing about a third year where I catalogue all the old mines — but that’s just the ramblings of an old man. 
        <br>
        I’ve felt this stupid compulsion to tell y’all this story. I don’t think it has any meaning. 
        <br>
        Here’s another one. In Turkey my parents went to a Hammam without me, and I wandered around the Grand Bazaar. In the middle of the Grand Bazaar is this room full of things worth something. Everything else sold in the grand bazaar is one degree removed from trash – meant to be bought in a currency who’s exchange rate makes buying things fun and thrown out when it can’t fit into your suitcase. This middle room is different. 
        <br>
        It is a large square, maybe 500 by 500 feet, and it is clearly about a 1000 years older than the rest of the market. It is subdivided into little claustrophobic rooms full of antiques and old men smoking and talking and very few people trying to buy anything. I saw a silver cigarette case with an engraving of a naked woman and the soviet flag and I asked the man how much it was and he laughed at me and refused to answer. I asked again. He laughed again. I asked again. He told me it was 750 USD. He then specified that it wasn’t Turkish lira, it was usd. I of course did not have 750 USD, so I walked away. The man laughed as I walked away. 
        <br>
        I vowed to myself that one day I would be rich. I just gave up on all life of service dreams immediately. One day I will come back with my pockets full of many 750 USD and I will buy every cigarette case, watch, and tiny ebony statue that that man had. </p>

  <h3>October 5th, 2025</h3>
  <div class="post-layout">
    <div class="post-text" id="Oct5">
      <p>I wrote a poem. It isn't very good but I have gotten stuck trying to make it better. 
        <br>
        Here it is:
        <br>
        Crossing the Brooklyn Bridge on September 26th, 2025
<br>
        The Italians and the Spanish and I walk along the bridge at the same speed<br>
        They walk shoulder to shoulder and all their words rhyme<br>
        We take in the glory of Manhattan in front of us and Brooklyn behind us<br>
        And we all think the same thing: The beavers could’ve never built the one world trade center!<br>
        <br>
        All the beavers have ever built are those pathetic little dams<br>
        Sometimes they don’t even have enough spirit to stick out of the water<br>
        And when they do they just look like a pile of sticks washed by the current.<br>
        And we’re supposed to want to save the animals?<br>
        <br>
        So the Italians and the Spanish and I bask in the lights that only we could’ve made<br>
        we capture it on our digicams and phones and vintage film cameras<br>
        I love the excess of images, now that they’re free to take and delete not 10 cents each<br>
        And we all pile our data on, taking a picture that 10,000 people have taken every night for 100 years<br>
        <br>
        But this feeling is so strong that it overtakes all reasonable parts of us<br>
        The beavers never built iphones or digicams or led string lights or ring lights or<br>
        rotating platforms covered in string lights and illuminated by a ring light that record on an iphone<br>
        and we play “empire state of mind” on our bluetooth speakers because it’s the only place we’re allowed to<br> 
        <br>
        Even though we all secretly know that it’s a perfect song <br>
        And in the same way every New Yorker knows New York is the best city<br>
        But they’ll never tell it to you. All they tell you is about how they almost moved to live with their cousin in Atlanta<br>
        And how they regret staying when forced to take the 4 train. But the 4 is a perfect line. And we both know it. <br>
        <br>
        Forget about the skyline, the beavers could’ve never even dreamed about the 4. <br>
        The beavers lack the capacity to imagine spaces underground at all<br>
        Each morning the 456 carries 6 million people, and I shuffle on to it, overjoyed to be one of them<br>
        And I can’t believe my luck that this miracle is waiting for me at the end of the bridge<br>
        <br>
        And even though the Italians and the Spanish and I are breathing in the micro particulate from the car brakes<br>
        And our brains all have a spoon’s worth of plastic lodged in them<br>
        And our sperm counts are halved by the microplastics or the radiation or something new we don’t even know about<br>
        We all take the bad with the good, and tonight the good wins by a landslide. <br>
      </br>
      Anyhow, thought I should go ahead and post it.

                    It’s Tuesday. I have taken a break. I am writing a play. Saturday was very enjoyable. Declan and I saw Ben and Shreya at the animal liberation parade. They have become simple. I like it a lot. It has been two years since I saw Shreya. It has felt like Ben was keeping us a secret from her, and I’m glad to be out in the open. It is also good to see them together. They touch each other a lot, she’s very touchy, and I think they are in love. This is all good. After seeing them, we went to Stella’s housewarming party. Koji and Ella Rose and Abie were there. They were talking and dancing and laughing and I felt overcome with joy. I spent like 15 minutes basking in their light while Declan talked to Anna Zikova and her friend. 
                    <br>
                    It felt like a vision from God, a burning-bush-esque miracle of what happiness could look like. Happiness that was found in people that I know have been unhappy, in people that I know have had hard and bad times with each other. Declan has accused us of having an underlying darkness, a shadow. I think he’s over exaggerating, but roughly correct. Life feels complicated and confusing, like an impenetrable web that I’m attempting to navigate, and I constantly run into bad memories and bad situations and spiral a little down and then spend days climbing back up. It all feels dangerous! 
                    <br>
                    Abie and Elsa Rose are like 25 and chilling and happy and in various stages of life and career and haven’t run away and haven’t left things behind but are just dancing at a party and laughing with each other. I find this so hopeful.

                    I went to the OnPoint training this morning. It reminded me of my limits. They are unwilling to judge desires, which I believe is pragmatically correct, but not actually the correct way to live life. They frequently fall back on “bodily autonomy,” which feels so fragile and insignificant to me. We have to have something better than bodily autonomy, some set of values more significant and meaningful than Mill’s Harm Principle. What I find actually frustrating about it is that they have a really strong set of values and a clear idea of a meaningful life. They have slides detailing the actions of the panthers and talking about revolution. The panthers were clear that dope combined with capitalism created a genocide, they embraced discipline, they declared what was good and bad, I think that’s why we admire them. Everyone working for OnPoint has also declared what is good and bad much further than the harm principle. I think it’s ok to admit that, and then act, in the short term, to enable bodily autonomy up to the point of death.

                    OnPoint’s revolutionary move was creating “Overdose Prevention Centers,” which are rooms where people go in and then use under constant supervision. Smoking is allowed in separate, ventilated rooms in the back, and then they have tables separated by dividers for people to inject, snort, or “booty bump,” which is where you dissolve a drug and put it up your butt. I’ve been thinking about a line in the Knausgaard book, that delivery rooms always smell a little bit like blood and intestines, that no matter how quickly the nurses and doctors hose down, disinfect, sanitize the room, the smell lingers and you know that countless people have given birth in this room. I imagine this same feeling would be present in OnPoint’s OPC’s where the space feels cluttered with the smell of smoking, the residue of fluids, the memories of how many people have OD’d and needed emergency treatment.

                    I have this neurotic feeling about almost all human built spaces, that they have memories, that what happened in the past does not go away, but just sinks deeper into the walls. Smell feels like our most sensitive sense. We can smell something wrong, even if the particles are too small or dispersed to see, even if the sounds have long dissipated. We are so good at smelling our own bodies, our shit, our fluids, wet and rotting. I wonder if this feeling that smells linger is why we think of smells most closely to memory, or if it’s the other way around.

                    The OnPoint building smells like the homeless shelter in Iowa, which smelt like the homeless shelter in Austin on 7th. The smell inside the Iowa homeless shelter is a really strong memory for me.  I don’t know what the combination is. Sanitizer, old donations,

                    The only thing that feels clean (what percentage of rooms has someone been raped in?) is nature. The forest revolves, breaks itself down, is always cleaning itself. The desert dries everything rotting out, bleaches it, sterilizes. Things that happen outside are forgotten in minutes or days or months or years. Even massive actions like meteor impacts are covered, filled in, grown over, until we have to use LiDAR to find them. I suspect this is a lot of the peace that comes with sleeping outside. 
                    <br>
                    OnPoint offers a service once a month where people can come in and get their feet cleaned. That’s one of the things I could try and do as a volunteer, kneel down and clean the feet of the street people I pass every day on Lexington.

                    Declan got spit on on Monday. We were walking east on 125th, towards 3rd ave. A man got up from against the barrier between Lexington and 3rd and walked up to us and spit on him. They hate him. They are ambivalent to me.

                    Similar to a hospital, OPC’s are built from stainless steel and use industrially manufactured furniture. Things that don’t break when they fall or are thrown. They are lit with bright and blue LED lights, and each table gets its own lamp. I respect the people that work the OPC so much. I believe that they are saving so many lives. I don’t know if I could just sit and watch people nearly kill themselves again and again.

                    Declan and I went to see Sophie/Sylvie in Williamsburg. Ainsley came along. I got Sharon to come too. It was not great. Afterwards, Declan, Ainsley, and Sophie Ubered to go see Sam Goldstein at a club with a 40 dollar cover. He had promised unlimited ketamine. I learned later that the unlimited ketamine was a lie, and they went from the club to Ainsley’s apartment, where they drank rum and ate ice cream.

                    I walked Sharon to a McDonalds and then to her house in Bushwick. It was nice. I felt bad, I had invited Sharon and we were essentially drinking in bars. Sharon is sober and doesn’t want to be around drug use. I had 1.5 beers and remained, as far as I could tell, sober. I stopped drinking when Sharon arrived. On the walk, Sharon and I spoke freely. We fought about being the same cohesive unified selves to every person we encountered, or changing who we are for each new sphere we are in. Sharon likes to keep her spheres separate. Sharon pronounces the “p” in the word sphere. S-p-here. I found it romantic and endearing. After the fight it was pleasant, and we shared personal details about our lives as we ate McDonalds on a bus stop bench. As we ate, a woman knelt down next to a man crumpled in front of the popeyes, woke him up, somehow recuperated him, and then walked away with him leaning on her. I thought it was beautiful and it amplified how useless and afraid I am.
