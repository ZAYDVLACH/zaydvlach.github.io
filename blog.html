                    It’s Tuesday. I have taken a break. I am writing a play. Saturday was very enjoyable. Declan and I saw Ben and Shreya at the animal liberation parade. They have become simple. I like it a lot. It has been two years since I saw Shreya. It has felt like Ben was keeping us a secret from her, and I’m glad to be out in the open. It is also good to see them together. They touch each other a lot, she’s very touchy, and I think they are in love. This is all good. After seeing them, we went to Stella’s housewarming party. Koji and Ella Rose and Abie were there. They were talking and dancing and laughing and I felt overcome with joy. I spent like 15 minutes basking in their light while Declan talked to Anna Zikova and her insane seeming friend. 
                    <br>
                    It felt like a vision from God, a burning-bush-esque miracle of what happiness could look like. Happiness that was found in people that I know have been unhappy, in people that I know have had hard and bad times with each other. Declan has accused us of having an underlying darkness, a shadow. I think he’s over exaggerating, but roughly correct. Life feels complicated and confusing, like an impenetrable web that I’m attempting to navigate, and I constantly run into bad memories and bad situations and spiral a little down and then spend days climbing back up. It all feels dangerous! 
                    <br>
                    Abie and Elsa Rose are like 25 and chilling and happy and in various stages of life and career and haven’t run away and haven’t left things behind but are just dancing at a party and laughing with each other. I find this so hopeful.
                    <br>
                    The motivating fear is my relationship with Norah. I don’t know what the future holds for it, and I think that the easiest path is to let it fall apart. This has been my choice in past relationships. I don’t want to do that at all.

                    I went to the OnPoint training this morning. It reminded me of my limits. They are unwilling to judge desires, which I believe is pragmatically correct, but not actually the correct way to live life. They frequently fall back on “bodily autonomy,” which feels so fragile and insignificant to me. We have to have something better than bodily autonomy, some set of values more significant and meaningful than Mill’s Harm Principle. What I find actually frustrating about it is that they have a really strong set of values and a clear idea of a meaningful life. They have slides detailing the actions of the panthers and talking about revolution. The panthers were clear that dope combined with capitalism created a genocide, they embraced discipline, they declared what was good and bad, I think that’s why we admire them. Everyone working for OnPoint has also declared what is good and bad much further than the harm principle. I think it’s ok to admit that, and then act, in the short term, to enable bodily autonomy up to the point of death. 
                    <br>
                    OnPoint’s revolutionary move was creating “Overdose Prevention Centers,” which are rooms where people go in and then use under constant supervision. Smoking is allowed in separate, ventilated rooms in the back, and then they have tables separated by dividers for people to inject, snort, or “booty bump,” which is where you dissolve a drug and put it up your butt. I’ve been thinking about a line in the Knausgaard book, that delivery rooms always smell a little bit like blood and intestines, that no matter how quickly the nurses and doctors hose down, disinfect, sanitize the room, the smell lingers and you know that countless people have given birth in this room. I imagine this same feeling would be present in OnPoint’s OPC’s where the space feels cluttered with the smell of smoking, the residue of fluids, the memories of how many people have OD’d and needed emergency treatment. 
                    <br>
                    I have this neurotic feeling about almost all human built spaces, that they have memories, that what happened in the past does not go away, but just sinks deeper into the walls. Smell feels like our most sensitive sense. We can smell something wrong, even if the particles are too small or dispersed to see, even if the sounds have long dissipated. We are so good at smelling our own bodies, our shit, our fluids, wet and rotting. I wonder if this feeling that smells linger is why we think of smells most closely to memory, or if it’s the other way around. 
                    <br>
                    The OnPoint building smells like the homeless shelter in Iowa, which smelt like the homeless shelter in Austin on 7th. The smell inside the Iowa homeless shelter is a really strong memory for me.  I don’t know what the combination is. Sanitizer, old donations, 
                    <br>
                    The only thing that feels clean (what percentage of rooms has someone been raped in?) is nature. The forest revolves, breaks itself down, is always cleaning itself. The desert dries everything rotting out, bleaches it, sterilizes. Things that happen outside are forgotten in minutes or days or months or years. Even massive actions like meteor impacts are covered, filled in, grown over, until we have to use LiDAR to find them. I suspect this is a lot of the peace that comes with sleeping outside. 
                    <br>
                    OnPoint offers a service once a month where people can come in and get their feet cleaned. That’s one of the things I could try and do as a volunteer, kneel down and clean the feet of the street people I pass every day on Lexington. 
                    <br>
                    Declan got spit on on Monday. We were walking east on 125th, towards 3rd ave. A man got up from against the barrier between Lexington and 3rd and walked up to us and spit on him. They hate him. They are ambivalent to me.
                    <br>
                    Similar to a hospital, OPC’s are built from stainless steel and use industrially manufactured furniture. Things that don’t break when they fall or are thrown. They are lit with bright and blue LED lights, and each table gets its own lamp. I respect the people that work the OPC so much. I believe that they are saving so many lives. I don’t know if I could just sit and watch people nearly kill themselves again and again.

                    Norah came on Saturday and left on Sunday. I watched Ainsley’s location like a sociopath. They stayed at her apartment 10 short blocks north and 4 long blocks west of me. I resent her for that. I resent Ainsley for enjoying her new position as the one who Norah is closest too. I’m not sure how Norah came to be a prized commodity that we gloat about having. After I crashed out with Declan I went to Rockaway. I took the 4 and the A to Rockaway 67. Apparently it is better to go further, 96 or 104 or something. This is what Merry told me this morning. I can go out there with my parents.
                    <br>
                    At the beach I felt good, and all of the obsessive and destructive thoughts left me. I felt sort of empty and hollow and peaceful and good, like the feeling of contentment after taking a massive shit. The sun set, I bought a pack of cigarettes for 13 dollars. I don’t want to get over her. I never want to get over anyone or anything. I’m worried about this because when I do end up getting over people I tend to drop them fully. I lack moderation.
                    <br>
                    While looking at the ocean, I thought about how Norah has communicated her confusion to me, how she’s repeatedly tried to tell me that she’s conflicted, and how she’s chafed against me needing to make our relationship stable. I think she’s tried to be honest with me, I think when she’s been lovely and clear and calls me baby as we FaceTime while she makes daal she’s also been telling the truth, and I think when she tells Sam Goldstein at Vassar that I’m her annoying ex who’s still in love with her while she’s over me it’s also true. I understand this. I also thought about how much she’s dealt with in her own life recently, namely Heather’s death. I should’ve gone with her to SF. I feel awful that she never saw Heather. I want to be filled with love. I am someone who believes in love. Last night, Sharon had an epiphany that I’m a romantic. She realized it and then laughed at me for a while. I think it was flattering. 
                    <br>
                    I would like to feel novel (mild novelty). Declan and I had a conversation where we glazed each other recently — it must have been on Saturday, and then Norah came on Sunday, and Declan and I went to Trader Joes on Monday. — where I advanced my non-slump thesis. That was such an overwhelmingly hopeful conversation, it feels like it shines brightly (blindingly) in my memory. I think it’s a bad sign that thinking about Norah right now causes me discomfort. On the beach I thought about when we went to the Jacob Riis beach together, about eating that burger with her, and then walking miles down the coast, exploring the abandoned building, and catching the bus at that weird stop. I love my life with her, I love my life in general. I am thinking about my conversations with Rose, about starting something new, about being in a new place, I should remind myself about all of this frequently. It would be easier if I wasn’t living with Declan, seeing Ainsley, etc, but I love my friends and who I am.

                    Declan and I went to see Sophie/Sylvie in Williamsburg. Ainsley came along. I got Sharon to come too. It was not great. Afterwards, Declan, Ainsley, and Sophie Ubered to go see Sam Goldstein at a club with a 40 dollar cover. He had promised unlimited ketamine. I learned later that the unlimited ketamine was a lie, and they went from the club to Ainsley’s apartment, where they drank rum and ate ice cream. Apparently Ainsley talked a lot. 
                    <br>
                    I walked Sharon to a McDonalds and then to her house in Bushwick. It was nice. I felt bad, I had invited Sharon and we were essentially drinking in bars. Sharon is sober and doesn’t want to be around drug use. I had 1.5 beers and remained, as far as I could tell, sober. I stopped drinking when Sharon arrived. On the walk, Sharon and I spoke freely. We fought about being the same cohesive unified selves to every person we encountered, or changing who we are for each new sphere we are in. Sharon likes to keep her spheres separate. Sharon pronounces the “p” in the word sphere. S-p-here. I found it romantic and endearing. After the fight it was pleasant, and we shared personal details about our lives as we ate McDonalds on a bus stop bench. As we ate, a woman knelt down next to a man crumpled in front of the popeyes, woke him up, somehow recuperated him, and then walked away with him leaning on her. I thought it was beautiful and it amplified how useless and afraid I am. 
                    <br>
                    Declan stayed the night at Ainsley’s and got brunch with her the next morning. He arrived back at noon, as Stella also arrived. We ate tofu tacos and talked about nothing. Afterwards Declan and I crashed and burned. I am currently in a really horrible mood. I am going to go to the beach to try and remedy this. It is painful to accept that Norah was lying to me and not just lying about me. This remains actually unbearable to accept, and each time I try and do it I am shot into a horrible spiral. Today it culminated in me taking a horrible stress shit, a shit that obviously should’ve waited another 12 hours to be further compacted and digested. It smelled fucking terrible. I am going to go sit at Rockaway. I can’t keep thinking about all of this shit.
