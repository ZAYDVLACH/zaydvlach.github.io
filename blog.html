    <div class="post-text" id="Nov9">
      <p>Here is a speech I wrote in my second year of Deep Springs. I think about it a lot. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I cannot figure out an elevator pitch. I give up. 
        In term 2 Declan and I climbed up to the Druid, and then we went a bit farther. I now always go a bit farther. I increasingly think that it’s hilarious, and sort of telling, that the normal hike is the druid. Upon reaching the druid you get a good look at our valley, and a good look at a big protruding rock, and a sort of vague idea about what’s outside of our valley. It’s a place to contemplate being in this valley, not to fantasize about escaping to the next valley over. 
        <br>
        In term 2 neither Declan nor I were really in the right headspace to contemplate being in this valley, so we kept walking. If you walk a mile or two further you cross the Inyo range and you begin to descend into Eureka. 
        <br>
        Here’s a secret (sort of):
        <br>
        Past the druid, if you climb up the hill in a straight line from the druid and follow the ridge of that hill you will eventually almost fall into an old mine. It’s about 30 feet deep and has the beginning of a collapsed tunnel at the bottom. I think I’ve only showed Declan. I recommend looking at it. 
        <br>
        Declan and I walked past the mine and climbed to my favorite rock and sat there a while. Declan smoked a cigarette. I made a comment about people who could laugh at a family funeral. It was very windy that day. The wind was so strong it hurt to look at the sand dunes. We turned around and walked back.
        <br>
        I’ve heard stories that the whole valley is covered in abandoned mines. Tim Winkler showed me one he found while 4 wheeling near chocolate mountain term 1. He drove me up there so I would know how to climb chocolate mountain with the first years. Recently I’ve been fantasizing about a third year where I catalogue all the old mines — but that’s just the ramblings of an old man. 
        <br>
        I’ve felt this stupid compulsion to tell y’all this story. I don’t think it has any meaning. 
        <br>
        Here’s another one. In Turkey my parents went to a Hammam without me, and I wandered around the Grand Bazaar. In the middle of the Grand Bazaar is this room full of things worth something. Everything else sold in the grand bazaar is one degree removed from trash – meant to be bought in a currency who’s exchange rate makes buying things fun and thrown out when it can’t fit into your suitcase. This middle room is different. 
        <br>
        It is a large square, maybe 500 by 500 feet, and it is clearly about a 1000 years older than the rest of the market. It is subdivided into little claustrophobic rooms full of antiques and old men smoking and talking and very few people trying to buy anything. I saw a silver cigarette case with an engraving of a naked woman and the soviet flag and I asked the man how much it was and he laughed at me and refused to answer. I asked again. He laughed again. I asked again. He told me it was 750 USD. He then specified that it wasn’t Turkish lira, it was usd. I of course did not have 750 USD, so I walked away. The man laughed as I walked away. 
        <br>
        I vowed to myself that one day I would be rich. I just gave up on all life of service dreams immediately. One day I will come back with my pockets full of many 750 USD and I will buy every cigarette case, watch, and tiny ebony statue that that man had. </p>
      </br>
        Here are portions of my diary:
        <br>
        I accepted the job offer at Epic. I’m not exactly sure why. I’m going to talk about reasons I think I did. 
        <br>
        Most generally, I feel itchy. I feel not as happy as I ought to, and I want to change things immediately, and I do not have the patience right now to wait for things to change slowly. On the worst days, it feels like I’m navigating this web of badness. That if I slip up a little in any direction I’m going to stumble and break something or fall into something and then be caught in a trap of baddness which I will have to pull myself out of. I want (this is not how the world works) it feel like I’m exploring a new terrain and I want to walk around and throw my limbs around explore fearlessly. This means that I will sometimes hurt people, and history makes life more complicated but also meaningful. But, right now, I feel restricted. I want to feel alive again. I feel more restricted than emboldened here. 
        <br>
        Another word is disturbing. I frequently feel disturbed. Disturbed by my own neuroses, by my friends, by our situations. 
        <br>
        Last night Abby said I was strangely afraid of evil. No shit. Why do I have this fear of god in me? Old memories have felt crushingly important recently. When Norah went on that walk with Shreya and then I wept and begged on my hands and knees. So yeah, I’m afraid of evil. 
        <br>
        At Hudson I had clarity and I told my friends, if norah breaks up with me I’m going to join the Navy. Norah broke up with me, but I was 9 months from graduation. I don’t think I really thought about it, I just kept going, but it feels like things have caught up with me. I have only recently grapsed the break up in its entirety, which I think I had properly understood at Hudson. I don’t really want to join the navy anymore, although I suspect that the navy would produce better results than this new job, i.e. a more radical shift in worldview. 
        <br>
        I feel bored and tired of who I am. I have been the same person for going on 5 years. It’s not that I dislike the person that I am, I am just getting bored. I want new ways to define myself. I want to live a day fully and not be overcome with memories. I am young and I want to feel young. I want new things to feel more important than past things. I want to be in love with someone new. Etc. So, Madison here I come! I hope to be back in 2 years. This is the strangest thing I’ve done since Deep Springs. I don’t expect it to have the same effect on me. 
        <br>
        I am not sure how well Declan is doing. He hasn’t gone on a run in weeks. Luc visited this week. I think it went well? I was away for most of it. Luc and I have developed a mutual comfort with one another, although I remain unsure of how to talk to him about things that matter. 
        <br>
        I dragged Declan out to see Luke, Andre, Sophia, Ainsley, etc on Friday night. On the way home, Declan said he was done disturbing his inner peace. Funny, maybe profound. I think the best place we got to was that I believe things can be insignificant, and he thinks that everything has to matter, to build on itself, to lead to the life to come. The morality to come, the revolution to come, the present is only ever justified in its service to the future that will absolve it of its sins. 
        <br>
        This cannot be the way to live. Kick back and drink a beer, fuck around for a day or a week or a year, live, laugh, love, or whatever. The revolution to come will never come if we are not living. Waiting for the future to come is to reject today, or at least to instrumentalize it. This is not revolutionary. Grace Lee Boggs’s irony is to embrace the present and to live for the revolution to come (democracy to come to make myself explicit). The ironic position seems most correct, but how should we start to get there? Should we position ourselves as perpetually waiting, disatisfied, or already satisfied? 
        <br>
        Then we got into a fight about morality. Declan claimed that a child could never do wrong, that it’s always the parent/guardian/culture’s fault when a child does wrong. I found this absurd. When does that change so we can say that a person should be blamed for their wrongs? At 18 (lol)? Upon graduation? And neither of us are willing to give up moral judgement. I have always thought of this position, which my mother shares, as a pragmatic neccesity for teachers. Teachers ought to treat their children with overwhelming love and forgiveness. To do this they can habituate themselves as never blaming their students for their misbehavior. But despite the pragmatic benefits, this is bullshit and there are evil children and children do bad things and some of them are good and some of them are bad and they are to blame, or none of us are to blame for anything. 
        <br>
        Last night, 24 hours after this conversation, Declan told me that I was talking about morality like he would minutes before he killed himself. Jesus. He told me if he doesn’t reground morality in the next 24 hours he will be in as deep a hole as I’ve ever seen him. Jesus. It was such an uneventful conversation. 
        <br>
        I think there’s a thread between these two conversations: me trying to be happy with the world as it is, and not living for the revolution to come, and thinking of morality as pragmatic choices we make, Declan needing m

  <h3>October 5th, 2025</h3>
  <div class="post-layout">
    <div class="post-text" id="Oct5">
      <p>I wrote a poem. It isn't very good but I have gotten stuck trying to make it better. 
        <br>
        Here it is:
        <br>
        Crossing the Brooklyn Bridge on September 26th, 2025
<br>
        The Italians and the Spanish and I walk along the bridge at the same speed<br>
        They walk shoulder to shoulder and all their words rhyme<br>
        We take in the glory of Manhattan in front of us and Brooklyn behind us<br>
        And we all think the same thing: The beavers could’ve never built the one world trade center!<br>
        <br>
        All the beavers have ever built are those pathetic little dams<br>
        Sometimes they don’t even have enough spirit to stick out of the water<br>
        And when they do they just look like a pile of sticks washed by the current.<br>
        And we’re supposed to want to save the animals?<br>
        <br>
        So the Italians and the Spanish and I bask in the lights that only we could’ve made<br>
        we capture it on our digicams and phones and vintage film cameras<br>
        I love the excess of images, now that they’re free to take and delete not 10 cents each<br>
        And we all pile our data on, taking a picture that 10,000 people have taken every night for 100 years<br>
        <br>
        But this feeling is so strong that it overtakes all reasonable parts of us<br>
        The beavers never built iphones or digicams or led string lights or ring lights or<br>
        rotating platforms covered in string lights and illuminated by a ring light that record on an iphone<br>
        and we play “empire state of mind” on our bluetooth speakers because it’s the only place we’re allowed to<br> 
        <br>
        Even though we all secretly know that it’s a perfect song <br>
        And in the same way every New Yorker knows New York is the best city<br>
        But they’ll never tell it to you. All they tell you is about how they almost moved to live with their cousin in Atlanta<br>
        And how they regret staying when forced to take the 4 train. But the 4 is a perfect line. And we both know it. <br>
        <br>
        Forget about the skyline, the beavers could’ve never even dreamed about the 4. <br>
        The beavers lack the capacity to imagine spaces underground at all<br>
        Each morning the 456 carries 6 million people, and I shuffle on to it, overjoyed to be one of them<br>
        And I can’t believe my luck that this miracle is waiting for me at the end of the bridge<br>
        <br>
        And even though the Italians and the Spanish and I are breathing in the micro particulate from the car brakes<br>
        And our brains all have a spoon’s worth of plastic lodged in them<br>
        And our sperm counts are halved by the microplastics or the radiation or something new we don’t even know about<br>
        We all take the bad with the good, and tonight the good wins by a landslide. <br>
      </br>
      Anyhow, thought I should go ahead and post it.

                    It’s Tuesday. I have taken a break. I am writing a play. Saturday was very enjoyable. Declan and I saw Ben and Shreya at the animal liberation parade. They have become simple. I like it a lot. It has been two years since I saw Shreya. It has felt like Ben was keeping us a secret from her, and I’m glad to be out in the open. It is also good to see them together. They touch each other a lot, she’s very touchy, and I think they are in love. This is all good. After seeing them, we went to Stella’s housewarming party. Koji and Ella Rose and Abie were there. They were talking and dancing and laughing and I felt overcome with joy. I spent like 15 minutes basking in their light while Declan talked to Anna Zikova and her insane seeming friend. 
                    <br>
                    It felt like a vision from God, a burning-bush-esque miracle of what happiness could look like. Happiness that was found in people that I know have been unhappy, in people that I know have had hard and bad times with each other. Declan has accused us of having an underlying darkness, a shadow. I think he’s over exaggerating, but roughly correct. Life feels complicated and confusing, like an impenetrable web that I’m attempting to navigate, and I constantly run into bad memories and bad situations and spiral a little down and then spend days climbing back up. It all feels dangerous! 
                    <br>
                    Abie and Elsa Rose are like 25 and chilling and happy and in various stages of life and career and haven’t run away and haven’t left things behind but are just dancing at a party and laughing with each other. I find this so hopeful.
                    <br>
                    The motivating fear is my relationship with Norah. I don’t know what the future holds for it, and I think that the easiest path is to let it fall apart. This has been my choice in past relationships. I don’t want to do that at all.

            <div class="post-layout">
              <div class="post-text" id="Sept4">
                <p>
                    I went to the OnPoint training this morning. It reminded me of my limits. They are unwilling to judge desires, which I believe is pragmatically correct, but not actually the correct way to live life. They frequently fall back on “bodily autonomy,” which feels so fragile and insignificant to me. We have to have something better than bodily autonomy, some set of values more significant and meaningful than Mill’s Harm Principle. What I find actually frustrating about it is that they have a really strong set of values and a clear idea of a meaningful life. They have slides detailing the actions of the panthers and talking about revolution. The panthers were clear that dope combined with capitalism created a genocide, they embraced discipline, they declared what was good and bad, I think that’s why we admire them. Everyone working for OnPoint has also declared what is good and bad much further than the harm principle. I think it’s ok to admit that, and then act, in the short term, to enable bodily autonomy up to the point of death. 
                    <br>
                    OnPoint’s revolutionary move was creating “Overdose Prevention Centers,” which are rooms where people go in and then use under constant supervision. Smoking is allowed in separate, ventilated rooms in the back, and then they have tables separated by dividers for people to inject, snort, or “booty bump,” which is where you dissolve a drug and put it up your butt. I’ve been thinking about a line in the Knausgaard book, that delivery rooms always smell a little bit like blood and intestines, that no matter how quickly the nurses and doctors hose down, disinfect, sanitize the room, the smell lingers and you know that countless people have given birth in this room. I imagine this same feeling would be present in OnPoint’s OPC’s where the space feels cluttered with the smell of smoking, the residue of fluids, the memories of how many people have OD’d and needed emergency treatment. 
                    <br>
                    I have this neurotic feeling about almost all human built spaces, that they have memories, that what happened in the past does not go away, but just sinks deeper into the walls. Smell feels like our most sensitive sense. We can smell something wrong, even if the particles are too small or dispersed to see, even if the sounds have long dissipated. We are so good at smelling our own bodies, our shit, our fluids, wet and rotting. I wonder if this feeling that smells linger is why we think of smells most closely to memory, or if it’s the other way around. 
                    <br>
                    The OnPoint building smells like the homeless shelter in Iowa, which smelt like the homeless shelter in Austin on 7th. The smell inside the Iowa homeless shelter is a really strong memory for me.  I don’t know what the combination is. Sanitizer, old donations, 
                    <br>
                    The only thing that feels clean (what percentage of rooms has someone been raped in?) is nature. The forest revolves, breaks itself down, is always cleaning itself. The desert dries everything rotting out, bleaches it, sterilizes. Things that happen outside are forgotten in minutes or days or months or years. Even massive actions like meteor impacts are covered, filled in, grown over, until we have to use LiDAR to find them. I suspect this is a lot of the peace that comes with sleeping outside. 
                    <br>
                    OnPoint offers a service once a month where people can come in and get their feet cleaned. That’s one of the things I could try and do as a volunteer, kneel down and clean the feet of the street people I pass every day on Lexington. 
                    <br>
                    Declan got spit on on Monday. We were walking east on 125th, towards 3rd ave. A man got up from against the barrier between Lexington and 3rd and walked up to us and spit on him. They hate him. They are ambivalent to me.
                    <br>
                    Similar to a hospital, OPC’s are built from stainless steel and use industrially manufactured furniture. Things that don’t break when they fall or are thrown. They are lit with bright and blue LED lights, and each table gets its own lamp. I respect the people that work the OPC so much. I believe that they are saving so many lives. I don’t know if I could just sit and watch people nearly kill themselves again and again.

                    Norah came on Saturday and left on Sunday. I watched Ainsley’s location like a sociopath. They stayed at her apartment 10 short blocks north and 4 long blocks west of me. I resent her for that. I resent Ainsley for enjoying her new position as the one who Norah is closest too. I’m not sure how Norah came to be a prized commodity that we gloat about having. After I crashed out with Declan I went to Rockaway. I took the 4 and the A to Rockaway 67. Apparently it is better to go further, 96 or 104 or something. This is what Merry told me this morning. I can go out there with my parents.

                    At the beach I felt good, and all of the obsessive and destructive thoughts left me. I felt sort of empty and hollow and peaceful and good, like the feeling of contentment after taking a massive shit. The sun set, I bought a pack of cigarettes for 13 dollars. I don’t want to get over her. I never want to get over anyone or anything. I’m worried about this because when I do end up getting over people I tend to drop them fully. I lack moderation.
                    <br>
                    While looking at the ocean, I thought about how Norah has communicated her confusion to me, how she’s repeatedly tried to tell me that she’s conflicted, and how she’s chafed against me needing to make our relationship stable. I think she’s tried to be honest with me, I think when she’s been lovely and clear and calls me baby as we FaceTime while she makes daal she’s also been telling the truth, and I think when she tells Sam Goldstein at Vassar that I’m her annoying ex who’s still in love with her while she’s over me it’s also true. I understand this. I also thought about how much she’s dealt with in her own life recently, namely Heather’s death. I should’ve gone with her to SF. I feel awful that she never saw Heather. I want to be filled with love. I am someone who believes in love. Last night, Sharon had an epiphany that I’m a romantic. She realized it and then laughed at me for a while. I think it was flattering.

                    I would like to feel novel (mild novelty). Declan and I had a conversation where we glazed each other recently — it must have been on Saturday, and then Norah came on Sunday, and Declan and I went to Trader Joes on Monday. — where I advanced my non-slump thesis. That was such an overwhelmingly hopeful conversation, it feels like it shines brightly (blindingly) in my memory. I think it’s a bad sign that thinking about Norah right now causes me discomfort. On the beach I thought about when we went to the Jacob Riis beach together, about eating that burger with her, and then walking miles down the coast, exploring the abandoned building, and catching the bus at that weird stop. I love my life with her, I love my life in general. I am thinking about my conversations with Rose, about starting something new, about being in a new place, I should remind myself about all of this frequently. It would be easier if I wasn’t living with Declan, seeing Ainsley, etc, but I love my friends and who I am.

                    Declan and I went to see Sophie/Sylvie in Williamsburg. Ainsley came along. I got Sharon to come too. It was not great. Afterwards, Declan, Ainsley, and Sophie Ubered to go see Sam Goldstein at a club with a 40 dollar cover. He had promised unlimited ketamine. I learned later that the unlimited ketamine was a lie, and they went from the club to Ainsley’s apartment, where they drank rum and ate ice cream. Apparently Ainsley talked a lot. 
                    <br>
                    I walked Sharon to a McDonalds and then to her house in Bushwick. It was nice. I felt bad, I had invited Sharon and we were essentially drinking in bars. Sharon is sober and doesn’t want to be around drug use. I had 1.5 beers and remained, as far as I could tell, sober. I stopped drinking when Sharon arrived. On the walk, Sharon and I spoke freely. We fought about being the same cohesive unified selves to every person we encountered, or changing who we are for each new sphere we are in. Sharon likes to keep her spheres separate. Sharon pronounces the “p” in the word sphere. S-p-here. I found it romantic and endearing. After the fight it was pleasant, and we shared personal details about our lives as we ate McDonalds on a bus stop bench. As we ate, a woman knelt down next to a man crumpled in front of the popeyes, woke him up, somehow recuperated him, and then walked away with him leaning on her. I thought it was beautiful and it amplified how useless and afraid I am. 
                    <br>
                    Declan stayed the night at Ainsley’s and got brunch with her the next morning. He arrived back at noon, as Stella also arrived. We ate tofu tacos and talked about nothing. Afterwards Declan and I crashed and burned. I am currently in a really horrible mood. I am going to go to the beach to try and remedy this. It is painful to accept that Norah was lying to me and not just lying about me. This remains actually unbearable to accept, and each time I try and do it I am shot into a horrible spiral. Today it culminated in me taking a horrible stress shit, a shit that obviously should’ve waited another 12 hours to be further compacted and digested. It smelled fucking terrible. I am going to go sit at Rockaway. I can’t keep thinking about all of this shit.
