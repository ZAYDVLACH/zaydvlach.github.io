  <h3>November 9th, 2025</h3>

      <p>Here is a speech I wrote in my second year of Deep Springs. I think about it a lot. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I cannot figure out an elevator pitch. I give up. 
        In term 2 Declan and I climbed up to the Druid, and then we went a bit farther. I now always go a bit farther. I increasingly think that it’s hilarious, and sort of telling, that the normal hike is the druid. Upon reaching the druid you get a good look at our valley, and a good look at a big protruding rock, and a sort of vague idea about what’s outside of our valley. It’s a place to contemplate being in this valley, not to fantasize about escaping to the next valley over. 
        <br>
        In term 2 neither Declan nor I were really in the right headspace to contemplate being in this valley, so we kept walking. If you walk a mile or two further you cross the Inyo range and you begin to descend into Eureka. 
        <br>
        Here’s a secret (sort of):
        <br>
        Past the druid, if you climb up the hill in a straight line from the druid and follow the ridge of that hill you will eventually almost fall into an old mine. It’s about 30 feet deep and has the beginning of a collapsed tunnel at the bottom. I think I’ve only showed Declan. I recommend looking at it. 
        <br>
        Declan and I walked past the mine and climbed to my favorite rock and sat there a while. Declan smoked a cigarette. I made a comment about people who could laugh at a family funeral. It was very windy that day. The wind was so strong it hurt to look at the sand dunes. We turned around and walked back.
        <br>
        I’ve heard stories that the whole valley is covered in abandoned mines. Tim Winkler showed me one he found while 4 wheeling near chocolate mountain term 1. He drove me up there so I would know how to climb chocolate mountain with the first years. Recently I’ve been fantasizing about a third year where I catalogue all the old mines — but that’s just the ramblings of an old man. 
        <br>
        I’ve felt this stupid compulsion to tell y’all this story. I don’t think it has any meaning. 
        <br>
        Here’s another one. In Turkey my parents went to a Hammam without me, and I wandered around the Grand Bazaar. In the middle of the Grand Bazaar is this room full of things worth something. Everything else sold in the grand bazaar is one degree removed from trash – meant to be bought in a currency who’s exchange rate makes buying things fun and thrown out when it can’t fit into your suitcase. This middle room is different. 
        <br>
        It is a large square, maybe 500 by 500 feet, and it is clearly about a 1000 years older than the rest of the market. It is subdivided into little claustrophobic rooms full of antiques and old men smoking and talking and very few people trying to buy anything. I saw a silver cigarette case with an engraving of a naked woman and the soviet flag and I asked the man how much it was and he laughed at me and refused to answer. I asked again. He laughed again. I asked again. He told me it was 750 USD. He then specified that it wasn’t Turkish lira, it was usd. I of course did not have 750 USD, so I walked away. The man laughed as I walked away. 
        <br>
        I vowed to myself that one day I would be rich. I just gave up on all life of service dreams immediately. One day I will come back with my pockets full of many 750 USD and I will buy every cigarette case, watch, and tiny ebony statue that that man had. </p>

  <h3>October 5th, 2025</h3>
  <div class="post-layout">
    <div class="post-text" id="Oct5">
      <p>I wrote a poem. It isn't very good but I have gotten stuck trying to make it better. 
        <br>
        Here it is:
        <br>
        Crossing the Brooklyn Bridge on September 26th, 2025
<br>
        The Italians and the Spanish and I walk along the bridge at the same speed<br>
        They walk shoulder to shoulder and all their words rhyme<br>
        We take in the glory of Manhattan in front of us and Brooklyn behind us<br>
        And we all think the same thing: The beavers could’ve never built the one world trade center!<br>
        <br>
        All the beavers have ever built are those pathetic little dams<br>
        Sometimes they don’t even have enough spirit to stick out of the water<br>
        And when they do they just look like a pile of sticks washed by the current.<br>
        And we’re supposed to want to save the animals?<br>
        <br>
        So the Italians and the Spanish and I bask in the lights that only we could’ve made<br>
        we capture it on our digicams and phones and vintage film cameras<br>
        I love the excess of images, now that they’re free to take and delete not 10 cents each<br>
        And we all pile our data on, taking a picture that 10,000 people have taken every night for 100 years<br>
        <br>
        But this feeling is so strong that it overtakes all reasonable parts of us<br>
        The beavers never built iphones or digicams or led string lights or ring lights or<br>
        rotating platforms covered in string lights and illuminated by a ring light that record on an iphone<br>
        and we play “empire state of mind” on our bluetooth speakers because it’s the only place we’re allowed to<br> 
        <br>
        Even though we all secretly know that it’s a perfect song <br>
        And in the same way every New Yorker knows New York is the best city<br>
        But they’ll never tell it to you. All they tell you is about how they almost moved to live with their cousin in Atlanta<br>
        And how they regret staying when forced to take the 4 train. But the 4 is a perfect line. And we both know it. <br>
        <br>
        Forget about the skyline, the beavers could’ve never even dreamed about the 4. <br>
        The beavers lack the capacity to imagine spaces underground at all<br>
        Each morning the 456 carries 6 million people, and I shuffle on to it, overjoyed to be one of them<br>
        And I can’t believe my luck that this miracle is waiting for me at the end of the bridge<br>
        <br>
        And even though the Italians and the Spanish and I are breathing in the micro particulate from the car brakes<br>
        And our brains all have a spoon’s worth of plastic lodged in them<br>
        And our sperm counts are halved by the microplastics or the radiation or something new we don’t even know about<br>
        We all take the bad with the good, and tonight the good wins by a landslide. <br>
      </br>
      Anyhow, thought I should go ahead and post it.

                <p>
                    It’s Tuesday. I have taken a break. I am writing a play. Saturday was very enjoyable. Declan and I saw Ben and Shreya at the animal liberation parade. They have become simple. I like it a lot. It has been two years since I saw Shreya. It has felt like Ben was keeping us a secret from her, and I’m glad to be out in the open. It is also good to see them together. They touch each other a lot, she’s very touchy, and I think they are in love. This is all good. After seeing them, we went to Stella’s housewarming party. Koji and Ella Rose and Abie were there. They were talking and dancing and laughing and I felt overcome with joy. I spent like 15 minutes basking in their light while Declan talked to Anna Zikova and her insane seeming friend. 
                    <br>
                    It felt like a vision from God, a burning-bush-esque miracle of what happiness could look like. Happiness that was found in people that I know have been unhappy, in people that I know have had hard and bad times with each other. Declan has accused us of having an underlying darkness, a shadow. I think he’s over exaggerating, but roughly correct. Life feels complicated and confusing, like an impenetrable web that I’m attempting to navigate, and I constantly run into bad memories and bad situations and spiral a little down and then spend days climbing back up. It all feels dangerous! 
                    <br>
                    Abie and Elsa Rose are like 25 and chilling and happy and in various stages of life and career and haven’t run away and haven’t left things behind but are just dancing at a party and laughing with each other. I find this so hopeful.

                    Declan and I went to see Sophie/Sylvie in Williamsburg. Ainsley came along. I got Sharon to come too. It was not great. Afterwards, Declan, Ainsley, and Sophie Ubered to go see Sam Goldstein at a club with a 40 dollar cover. He had promised unlimited ketamine. I learned later that the unlimited ketamine was a lie, and they went from the club to Ainsley’s apartment, where they drank rum and ate ice cream. Apparently Ainsley talked a lot. 
                    <br>
                    I walked Sharon to a McDonalds and then to her house in Bushwick. It was nice. I felt bad, I had invited Sharon and we were essentially drinking in bars. Sharon is sober and doesn’t want to be around drug use. I had 1.5 beers and remained, as far as I could tell, sober. I stopped drinking when Sharon arrived. On the walk, Sharon and I spoke freely. We fought about being the same cohesive unified selves to every person we encountered, or changing who we are for each new sphere we are in. Sharon likes to keep her spheres separate. Sharon pronounces the “p” in the word sphere. S-p-here. I found it romantic and endearing. After the fight it was pleasant, and we shared personal details about our lives as we ate McDonalds on a bus stop bench. As we ate, a woman knelt down next to a man crumpled in front of the popeyes, woke him up, somehow recuperated him, and then walked away with him leaning on her. I thought it was beautiful and it amplified how useless and afraid I am. 
                    <br>
                    Declan stayed the night at Ainsley’s and got brunch with her the next morning. He arrived back at noon, as Stella also arrived. We ate tofu tacos and talked about nothing. Afterwards Declan and I crashed and burned. I am currently in a really horrible mood. I am going to go to the beach to try and remedy this. It is painful to accept that Norah was lying to me and not just lying about me. This remains actually unbearable to accept, and each time I try and do it I am shot into a horrible spiral. Today it culminated in me taking a horrible stress shit, a shit that obviously should’ve waited another 12 hours to be further compacted and digested. It smelled fucking terrible. I am going to go sit at Rockaway. I can’t keep thinking about all of this shit.
